TITLE: Audi in Formula One

German car manufacturer Audi is contracted to compete in Formula One as a constructor and power unit manufacturer from 2026 onwards. Audi Revolut F1 Team was formed through the acquisition of Sauber Motorsport, with engines developed by Audi Formula Racing GmbH.
Prior to World War II, Audi's predecessor Auto Union contested Grand Prix motor racing from 1935 to 1939. Audi announced their intention to acquire Sauber—who debuted in 1993—and its Swiss facilities in 2022, ahead of new power unit and chassis regulations in 2026. The project expanded to a power unit facility in Bavaria and a technology centre in the "Motorsport Valley" of Oxfordshire, England.


== Background ==


=== Pre–World War II Grands Prix (1935–1939) ===

Whilst the modern Audi company has never entered Grand Prix motor racing, its predecessor company Auto Union had competed in Grand Prix racing from 1935 to 1939, prior to World War II and the inception of the Formula One World Championship in 1950. 
Auto Union was founded in 1932, during the Great Depression, as a merger of four struggling automotive firms: Audi, DKW, Horch, and Wanderer. The following year, German Chancellor Adolf Hitler announced a state-sponsored motor racing programme with Mercedes-Benz. Upon request from Ferdinand Porsche, Hitler agreed that competition between two German firms would improve their chances of victory and national glory; an annual 500,000 ℛℳ (£40,000; £3,590,000 in 2023) prize for the most successful car between Auto Union and Mercedes-Benz was announced, eventually rising to 3,125,000 ℛℳ (£250,000; £22,420,000 in 2023) and prompting a heated rivalry.
Across five seasons in the AIACR European Championship, Auto Union won seven Grandes Épreuves and 14 non-championship Grands Prix. Bernd Rosemeyer claimed European Drivers' Championship in 1936, driving the Type C, with victories at the German, Swiss, and Italian Grands Prix. Hermann Paul Müller—driving the Type D—unofficially won the final edition in 1939, with the title not awarded due to the onset of World War II in Europe following the invasion of Poland. Auto Union was later absorbed by Volkswagen in 1964, becoming the modern-day Audi company.


=== Zurich-based constructors (1993–2025) ===

The antecedent constructor to Audi based in Hinwil—Sauber—made its Formula One debut in 1993, having contested sportscar racing since 1970. The team was partnered with Mercedes-Benz until 1994, Ford until 1996, and Petronas until 2005, before becoming the factory team for BMW from 2006 to 2009. Sauber claimed its highest finishes in the World Constructors' Championship with second and third in 2007 and 2008, respectively, the former after a disqualification for McLaren and the latter including its sole victory at the Canadian Grand Prix with Robert Kubica. It returned as an independent constructor in 2010 with Ferrari engines, repurchased by Peter Sauber following the Great Recession and a failed shell company acquisition. A title sponsorship deal with Alfa Romeo in 2018 led to a full rebrand from 2019 to 2023, after which it switched to support from Stake and Kick.


== Constructor history ==


=== Establishment (2022–2025) ===
In August 2022, Audi announced that it would enter Formula One as a power unit manufacturer in 2026—the planned year for a regulation overhaul. That October, Audi confirmed its rumoured partnership with Sauber, acquiring a stake in the company for a full rebrand and power unit deal. In November 2024, the Qatar Investment Authority purchased a minority stake in the team. 
Veteran midfield driver Nico Hülkenberg and rookie Gabriel Bortoleto joined Sauber on separate multi-year contracts from 2025 onwards, thus becoming Audi's driver lineup upon its debut. Neel Jani was signed as a simulator driver to assist with car development. By July of that year, Sauber opened the Sauber Motorsport Technology Centre in Bicester Motion, Oxfordshire, with the aim of attracting specialised personnel to join the team in the "Motorsport Valley" region of England. The technology centre aims to complement the primary headquarters in Hinwil, Switzerland, where the chassis is constructed.
Audi signed a multi-year deal with British financial technology company Revolut to become the title sponsor of the team.


=== Debut (2026) ===
Audi are set to debut at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in 2026 with the R26, designed for new chassis and power unit regulations.


== Team information ==


=== Constructor personnel ===
Jonathan Wheatley is the inaugural team principal of Audi, with Mattia Binotto serving as the project head and James Key as the technical director.


=== Power unit programme ===
The Audi power unit programme will be operated by the subsidiary Audi Formula Racing GmbH, based in Neuburg an der Donau, Bavaria, Germany.


=== Racing licence and facilities ===
Audi competes with a German racing licence and is based at three facilities across Europe:

Chassis department: former Sauber headquarters in Hinwil, Zurich, Switzerland;
