TITLE: List of Formula One driver records

The World Championship of Drivers has been held since 1950. Driver records listed here include all rounds which formed part of the World Championship since 1950: this includes the Indianapolis 500 from 1950–1960 (although it was not run to Formula One rules), and the 1952 and 1953 World Championship Grands Prix (which were run to Formula Two rules). Formula One races that were not qualification rounds for the World Championship are not included, and sprints are only included when specified.


== Races entered and started ==
Drivers are considered to be entered into a race if they attempt to compete in at least one official practice session with the intent of participating in the race. These drivers are noted on the entry list for that race. A driver is considered to have started a race if they line up on the grid or at the pit lane exit for the start of the race. If a race is stopped and restarted, participation in any portion of the race is counted only if that portion was in any way counted towards the final classification (e.g. races stopped before the end of the leader's second lap were declared null and void prior to 2005).
