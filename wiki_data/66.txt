TITLE: Formula One sponsorship liveries

Formula One sponsorship liveries have been used since the 1968 season. Before the arrival of sponsorship liveries in 1968 the nationality of the team determined the colour of a car entered by the team, e.g. cars entered by Italian teams were rosso corsa red, cars entered by French teams were bleu de France blue, and cars entered by British teams (with several exceptions, such as cars entered by teams Rob Walker, Brabham and McLaren) were British racing green. Major sponsors such as BP, Shell, and Firestone had pulled out of the sport ahead of this season, prompting the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile to allow unrestricted sponsorship.
Team Gunston became the first Formula One team to implement sponsorship brands as a livery on their Brabham car, which privately entered for John Love in orange, brown and gold colours of Gunston cigarettes in the first race of the 1968 season, the 1968 South African Grand Prix, on 1 January 1968. In the next race, the 1968 Spanish Grand Prix, Team Lotus, initially using British racing green, became the first works team to follow this example, with Graham Hill's Lotus 49B entered in the red, gold and white colors of Imperial Tobacco's Gold Leaf brand. With rising costs in Formula One, sponsors became more important and thus liveries reflected the teams' sponsors.
Tobacco advertising was common in motorsport; as bans spread throughout the world, teams began using an alternate livery which alluded to the tobacco sponsor. At historical events, cars are allowed to use the livery which was used when the car was actively competing. Prior to 2022, special liveries were uncommon; excluding country-specific legislation that would require mandatory changes to specific sponsorship elements, most commonly tobacco and nicotine, very few one-off liveries were run in Formula One. The  Jaguar team introduced their first one-off livery at the 2004 Monaco Grand Prix, beginning a trend of one-off liveries that continued until the early 2010's. Since then, special liveries were uncommonly seen on track. In 2021, a special livery introduced by McLaren for the Monaco Grand Prix required them to receive special dispensation from the FIA. Since then, the amount of special liveries run by teams on the grid have increased.


== AGS ==


== Alfa Romeo ==
Alfa Romeo was a Formula One constructor between 1950 and 1951, and again between 1979 and 1985. In 1950–1951 and 1979, the team used the rosso corsa (racing red) national color of Italy. In 1980, they switched to a livery sponsored by Philip Morris's Marlboro cigarette brand. In 1984, the Italian clothing brand Benetton took over Alfa Romeo's livery sponsorship, which they held until the withdrawal of Alfa Romeo from Formula One at the end of 1985. Alfa Romeo returned as a constructor from 2019 to 2023 with the rebranding of Sauber.


== AlphaTauri ==
Scuderia Toro Rosso was rebranded as Scuderia AlphaTauri in 2020 to promote Red Bull fashion brand AlphaTauri. Along with the rebrand, the team is no longer a junior team but a sister team to Red Bull Racing. The team was rebranded as RB in 2024.


== Alpine ==
Renault was rebranded as Alpine F1 Team in 2021 to promote Renault brand Alpine.


== Andrea Moda ==


== Arrows ==
Starting in the 1970s and going for decades until ending in mid-2002, Arrows, that was known as Footwork for a few years in the 1990s, had distinctive liveries, like the unusual Ruffles sponsorship in Footwork, an all-black car in the 1998 season, and an orange car in its final years.


== Aston Martin ==
Aston Martin competed in Formula One in 1958–59. The team returned in 2021 with the rebranding of Racing Point by Lawrence Stroll.


== ATS ==


== Audi ==
Audi entered Formula One in 2026 through a takeover of Sauber. The company's predecessor, Auto Union, has competed in Grand Prix motor racing.


== Benetton ==
Benetton Formula Ltd. was a Formula One constructor that participated from 1986 to 2001. The team was owned by the Benetton family who run a worldwide chain of clothing stores of the same name. In 2000 the team was purchased by Renault, but competed as Benetton for the 2001 season. In 2002 the team became Renault F1. From 1991 to 1993, Camel sponsored the Benetton team, but, from 1994 to 2001 the main sponsor was Mild Seven.


== BMS Scuderia Italia ==
In its Dallara years, Scuderia Italia raced with a livery slightly similar to Ferrari (rosso corsa with white details and black wings), but prior to the absorption by Minardi in 1993, when raced with Lola cars, had a white livery with red and yellow flames.


== BMW Sauber ==
After having been an engine supplier in the 1980s and again since 2000, BMW entered Formula One with a works team of its own in 2006 after buying Sauber. The livery was based on the traditional BMW Motorsport team colours of white with light blue, dark blue and a little red (in an almost purple shade). White is also the original national racing colour of Germany, while white and blue are the colours of Bavaria and of BMW itself. On 27 November 2009, BMW agreed to sell the team back to its original founder, Peter Sauber.


== Brabham ==
Prior to sponsorships, Brabham raced in turquoise with a gold band running across the car. This later changed to green and gold, the racing colours of Australia, as a mark of the nationality of the team's owner Jack Brabham. A Brabham car was the first Formula One car painted in the livery of a team's sponsor when Team Gunston as a privateer team entered a private Brabham car at the first race of the 1968 season (the 1968 South African Grand Prix). In 1975 and 1976, Brabham received sponsorship from Martini; in 1976 the color scheme changed from white to red with light blue trim. The primary sponsor changed to Parmalat in 1978, with the cars retaining a variant of the same red and blue colors. With the team's switch to BMW engines in 1982, the new livery consisted of a clean dark blue and white with a stylized BMW "kidney grille" on the nose. This scheme was retained throughout the BMW years, even through a sponsorship change to Olivetti in 1985, until 1989. (This unusual representation of the engine supplier, specifically BMW, in the color scheme was revived by Williams when they debuted their own BMW cars in 2000.) In 1989, Brabham signed with Bioptron, a brand of Zepter International, which continued until the team was bought by Middlebridge Group. Since then, it was sponsored by many Japanese companies like Garage Italiya, a company that imports Italian cars in Japan, Autobacs, Nippon Shinpan, and Mitsukoshi. In its final season Brabham raced in blue and pink livery of the Japanese metal group Seikima-II.


== Brawn GP ==
After Honda pulled out of F1 at the end of 2008, team boss Ross Brawn struggled to find a buyer to save the team, eventually buying it himself. A lack of sponsors resulted in the white livery, with flashes of bright yellow and black. Towards the end of the season, the team arranged one-race sponsor deals with a variety of major local companies, including Canon, Mapfre, Itaipava and Qtel.
Brawn GP dominated the early part of the 2009 season, with Jenson Button winning six of the first seven races. As other teams improved their cars, Brawn struggled for pace, but still recorded several podiums during the rest of the year. Their strong start and consistent finish was enough to secure the Constructors World Championship at the first (and only) attempt, as well as the drivers title with Jenson Button. At the end of the season, the team was purchased by engine supplier Mercedes-Benz.


== British American Racing ==
British American Racing competed in Formula One from 1999 to 2005. The name was a reference to the team owner, British American Tobacco, hence the livery which included two of its main cigarette brands. In their debut season, the team wished to have its two cars painted in different liveries (one 555, the other Lucky Strike), but this was forbidden by the rules. So the team decided on a unique two-sided design, with the blue 555 livery of the right side of the car, and the red and white Luckies livery on the left and a zipper design on the middle. .


== British Racing Motors ==
The first cars entered by the BRM works team were a pale duck-egg green (any shade of green represented British racing green, the national racing colour of Great Britain), but this was later replaced for aesthetic reasons by a very dark metallic shade of grey-green. BRM cars entered by non-British privateer teams wore their respective national racing colours. The team acquired their first significant commercial sponsorship from Yardley for the 1970 season, running in white with black, gold and ochre stripes in a stylised "Y" wrapping around the car's bodywork. In the 1972 season the team became the first F1 team sponsored by Marlboro and at the 1972 Monaco Grand Prix the BRM team achieved the first win for a Marlboro-sponsored F1 car.


== Cadillac ==
Cadillac entered Formula One in 2026.


== Caterham ==
Lotus Racing, later Team Lotus, was renamed to Caterham in 2012 after a dispute on the usage of the Lotus name between team founder and principal Tony Fernandes and Group Lotus. While the team raced with a Malaysian licence, it used a British racing green livery similar to its predecessor team. Caterham then used a lighter green livery for the next two seasons before going into administration.

== Ensign ==


== Eifelland ==

== Ferrari ==
In keeping with their Italian roots, the Ferrari works team has always kept a red colour in the tradition of rosso corsa, the national racing colour of Italy, except for last two races in the 1964 season (the 1964 United States Grand Prix and 1964 Mexican Grand Prix) when Enzo Ferrari let his cars be entered by the NART team in American national racing colours (white with blue lengthwise "Cunningham racing stripes") to protest against Italian racing authorities. However, Ferrari cars entered by non-Italian privateer teams wore their respective national racing colours until the 1961 Belgian Grand Prix when Belgian driver Olivier Gendebien privately entered a Ferrari car in the Belgian racing yellow colour. Over the years, rosso corsa has been combined with white parts and with various sponsorship schemes, but Ferrari has never fully let their cars be dominated by the sponsorship livery like many other teams have. This changed in the 1990s when Ferrari replaced their traditional rosso corsa colour with a "Marlboro red" which is noticeably lighter; this colour remains despite the ban on tobacco sponsorship. Ferrari had Marlboro as the team's title sponsor (renamed as Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro) from 1997 until the 2011 European Grand Prix and as one of team's main sponsors from 1993 to 2017 (Marlboro had first been seen on Ferrari F1 cars in 1984 largely due to then driver Michele Alboreto's personal sponsorship with the brand). Philip Morris continued to sponsor Ferrari as Mission Winnow in 2018 (renamed as Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow). Ferrari reverted to its rosso corsa colors in 2022 after Philip Morris lost its livery sponsorship rights.

== Honda ==
Honda first raced in Formula One from 1964 to 1968. The cars were entered in an all-white livery with a red circle (duplicating the Japanese flag), the national racing colour of Japan. The company won two races but left F1 at the end of the 1968 season, before returning as an engine supplier in the 1980s. Honda in the 1990s never raced, but created prototypes like the RC100 and the RA099 tested at Suzuka Circuit.
After a decade away from the sport, Honda returned again as an engine supplier in 2001, before buying the British American Racing team and entering F1 as a constructor in 2006.
For the 2006 season, Honda continued with the BAT sponsorship with the Lucky Strike logo, but BAT pulled out for 2007. From 2007, the only logos on the car are the Honda badge, the Bridgestone logo, and the logo of Honda's environmental awareness program, Earth Dreams. For 2007, the livery itself was a picture of the Earth on a black background. For 2008, however, there are only pieces of the image of Earth on a mainly white background, as opposed to the whole of the Earth being on Honda's car.

Lotus also had one of the longest sponsorship cooperations in Formula One history, making the black and gold of its John Player Special seasons (1972-1978 and 1981-1986) one of the best known liveries to this day.


== Lotus (2010–2011) ==
The new Lotus team, Lotus Racing and later Team Lotus, made its début in 2010. It competed with a license from Malaysia but used a British racing green livery similar to the original Team Lotus.

== Lotus (2012–2015) ==
Renault, then competing as Lotus Renault GP in 2011, was renamed Lotus F1 Team in 2012 following a dispute on the usage of the Lotus name between Group Lotus (who was allowed to use the "Lotus" name and roundel) and Lotus Racing/Team Lotus founder and team principal Tony Fernandes (who was allowed to only use the "Team Lotus" name and roundel). The team was owned by Luxembourg-based venture capital group Genii Capital (who bought a majority stake in Renault) and named after its branding partner Group Lotus. Its livery, introduced back in 2011 with the Renault R31, was designed as a tribute to the Team Lotus cars of 1981–1986 and their famous John Player Special liveries.

== McLaren ==
McLaren's first Formula One car raced at the 1966 Monaco Grand Prix was painted white with a green stripe to represent a fictional Yamura team in John Frankenheimer's film Grand Prix. Though the team has been based and licensed in Britain, McLaren has never entered their cars in British racing green. Between 1968 and 1971, the team used an orange design, dubbed the papaya orange, which was also applied to their cars competing in the Indianapolis 500 and Can-Am. McLaren signed its first title sponsor in 1972 with Yardley London. From 1974 to 1996, McLaren and Marlboro had the longest title sponsorship deal in Formula One history which lasted for 23 consecutive seasons. McLaren then aligned with West (1997–2005) and Vodafone (2007–2013) as their title sponsor. Throughout those years, McLaren's livery colours reflected the colours of the title sponsors.
Since 2017, McLaren returned to using its traditional papaya orange colours, which was also used on their cars entered in other racing series such as Extreme E and Formula E. In 2021, the team, still without a title sponsor, received a special approval from the FIA to race a special one-off Gulf livery in collaboration with long time sponsor Gulf Oil for the Monaco Grand Prix. This then began a trend of special one-off liveries in Formula One.


== Mercedes-Benz ==
Mercedes-Benz first competed in Formula One during the 1954 and 1955 seasons. This was in the time before sponsorship liveries and the team was using an all silver livery, the national racing color of Germany. The team was absent from Formula One after this, returning in 1994 as an engine supplier.
Mercedes-Benz rejoined Formula One as a team in 2010 after having purchased the Brawn GP team on 16 November 2009. On 21 December 2009 it signed a €30 million per season contract with Petronas as title sponsor. The blueish green livery color of Petronas is just present as fine lines at the side of the car, which overall is mainly painted in silver like historic Mercedes race cars of the 1930s and 1950s. To celebrate their 125th anniversary in motorsport, Mercedes-Benz decided to launch a special one-off livery for the 2019 German Grand Prix. The livery was a homage to the first racing cars that Mercedes made.

Since its first season in 2005 the car livery did not change much, always keeping Red Bull as the main sponsor. This changed in 2013, when Infiniti became the team's title sponsor and Red Bull's branding on the car was reduced.
Red Bull have used special liveries on multiple occasions, supporting the release of upcoming films and company's charity program Wings for Life.

The team had a title contract with Mild Seven from 2002 to 2006, before switching to ING Group from the 2007 season to the 2009 Italian Grand Prix when ING withdrew all association with Renault. The team was sold and competed as Lotus from the 2012-2015 seasons, before Renault bought back the team and returned as a constructor in 2016.

Williams, as a major constructor, is rare in modern F1 in that they have no manufacturer backing. Over the years, the supply of engines and other major components has often changed, meaning that their livery is renewed more often than most of their rivals. The BMW-engined Williams cars from 2000 to 2005 featured a dark blue and white scheme.
